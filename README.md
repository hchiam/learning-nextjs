# Learning Next.js

Just one of the things I'm learning. <https://github.com/hchiam/learning>

Server React apps/sites faster on the web by rendering them on the server (like SSR), while still being interactive, and being crawlable for SEO. Folders and files map out the URL routes. SSG (build and cache a small static site), SSR (serve latest), ISR (regenerate page with min time interval).

## From scratch

```bash
npx create-next-app my-app
cd my-app
npm run dev # or: yarn dev
```

Then open <http://localhost:3000>

Or `my-app`, try opening <http://localhost:3000/hello> or <http://localhost:3000/cars/1234>

The `/api` routes are just for server/BackEnd-only or API usage.
